# Increase Browser Speed
This is a technology I have been engeneering for the past year. It works by anaylizing browser traffic and dropping unessesary requests, which are actually a large majority of the requests for a ton of sites.

To run, copy the code from `code.js` into the console of your browser on the page you want to test it on, and press enter. Reloading the page will put it back to how it was before. 

Currently it only works on one site at a time (you have to run the code once per tab you want to use it on), but eventually when I get all the bugs worked out I will turn it into an extension so it can run on all pages at the same time. 

## Only supports chrome at the moment, I have no idea how it would work on other browsers

<sub>This is totally not a scam to overload your browser with rickroll windows</sub>
